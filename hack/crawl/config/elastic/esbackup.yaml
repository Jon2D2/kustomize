# ESBackup depends on ESCluster, and is depended by ESSnapshot.
# Creating `esbackup/kustomize-backbup` will create the `kustomize-backup` snapshot repository.
# Deleting `esbackup/kustomize-backbup` will delete the `kustomize-backup` snapshot repository.
# Deleting `esbackup/kustomize-backbup` will NOT delete the snapshots in the `kustomize-backup` snapshot repository, instead makes all the snapshots in the repository inaccessible.
# Deleting `esbackup/kustomize-backbup` will NOT delete the essnapshot objects depending on it, but will cause those essnapshot objects to be reconciled, which update the status of the essnapshot objects to reflect the fact that the esbackup object is missing.
# If you delete the `kustomize-backup` snapshot repository directly without deleting `esbackup/kustomize-backbup`, the ESBackup object will not recreate the snapshot repository.
